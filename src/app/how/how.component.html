        <h2>Crash Course:</h2>

        <p>
            Welcome to VISUALZ. When you open the app a new blank track will be created for you automatically. You can
            toggle between the Track List and Content in the left sidebar.
        </p>

        <p>
            Add some content by clicking the add content button to open the menu. Start by adding a Gif to your track.
            Its easy, just click "Gif".
        </p>

        <p>
            Great. Now that you have a gif in there you can see how easy it is to add more types of content to your
            track. You can control content details and settings in the right sidebar. Just click the block you want to
            edit.
        </p>

        <h2>Beat Visualizer</h2>

        <p>
            The beat visualizer is one of the main pieces of VISUALZ. It uses volume amplitude and peak detection to
            detect beats and changes in the music.
        </p>

        <p>
            The threshold for beat detection can be adjusted to make it more or less sensitive or to handle different
            volume levels. The threshold setting is located in the Track Settings panel, so you can have different
            thresholds per track.
        </p>

        <p>
            By default content changes on the main screen every four beat changes (~every measure). The main screen can
            change on the beat, every other beat, the measure, or every other measure. This option is in the
            Track Settings panel.
        </p>

        <h2>Content Blocks</h2>

        <p>
            You can compose a set or track with different types of visual content. These content types are called
            content blocks. When you click on a type of conent in the left sidebar it will be added to the track's
            content slots. Settings for individual content blocks can be found in the Content Settings panel which is
            visible when you select a block in the track's content slots.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are several types of content blocks in VISUALZ:
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Image</strong> - Just like it sounds you can upload any image you want in your set/track.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Video</strong> - Upload any video to your set/track.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Webcam</strong> - Connect your webcam to include shots of the artist or the crowd.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Color</strong> - Very simple color content.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Text</strong> - Need some text on the screen? That's what this is for.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Bubbles</strong> - Bubbles effect. This is one of the first code generated effects in the system.

        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Oscilliscope</strong> - An actual oscilliscope code generated effect that responds to the actual
            audio frequencies in the music.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Gif</strong> - The gif block will grab a random gif and insert it into the set. You can type in a
            search tag to get gifs related to any subject you want.
